#Algorithm

**Introduction** This is algorithm learning based on java. The material is *Algorithm: Fourth Edition* written by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. You can find the sources on http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/, and you can find courses on https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI and https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII. In this learning program, we use notepad++ with nppexec to run java.

**Java** You can download java and textbook libraries from http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/. If you are not good at Java, you can follow another introductory text, *An Intruduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary Approach*.

**Notepad++** We use notepad++ nothing but cool.
